# First-Bootstrap-Project-Surf-Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project! This project serves as an opportunity for me to practice building the front end of a website using the Bootstrap front-end framework. As a beginner in web development, I aim to familiarize myself with Bootstrap's features, components, and responsive design capabilities through hands-on experience.

### Project Goals

- Gain practical experience in using Bootstrap to create responsive and visually appealing web designs.
- Explore Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities for layout and styling.
- Understand how to leverage Bootstrap's pre-built CSS and JavaScript components to enhance the functionality of the website.
- Practice integrating Bootstrap with HTML and CSS to build modern and user-friendly web interfaces.

Through this project, I hope to improve my skills in front-end web development and become proficient in using Bootstrap as a versatile tool for building responsive websites.
